# polkadot-devcamp-project-2022
A secured messaging application One can send messages to others using substrate address as their identity Everyone will get a copy of the message, and the message content of each copy will be encrypted using each one’s public key. So only the one with an appropriate private key can decrypt the message. The message content will be stored on-chain with limited characters or on an external decentralized service like IPFS To limit the scope of the project, we’ll try to implement one-to-one messaging mechanism, one-to-many messaging will be an improvement point for the future
